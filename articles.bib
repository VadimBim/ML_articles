  abstract  = "X-ray spectroscopic data from high-energy-density laser-produced
               plasmas has long required thorough, time-consuming analysis to
               extract meaningful source conditions. There are often
               confounding factors due to rapidly evolving states and finite
               spatial gradients (e.g., the existence of multi-temperature,
               multi-density, multi-ionization states, etc.) that make spectral
               measurements and analysis difficult. Here, we demonstrate how
               deep learning can be applied to enhance x-ray spectral data
               analysis in both speed and intricacy. Neural networks (NNs) are
               trained on ensemble atomic physics simulations so that they can
               subsequently construct a model capable of extracting plasma
               parameters directly from experimental spectra. Through deep
               learning, the models can extract temperature distributions as
               opposed to single or dual temperature/density fits from standard
               trial-and-error atomic modeling at a significantly reduced
               computational cost compared to traditional trial-and-error
               methods. These NNs are envisioned to be deployed with high
               repetition rate x-ray spectrometers in order to provide detailed
               real-time analysis of experimental spectra.",
