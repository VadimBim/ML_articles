  abstract  = "High-energy-density physics is the field of physics concerned
               with studying matter at extremely high temperatures and
               densities. Such conditions produce highly nonlinear plasmas, in
               which several phenomena that can normally be treated
               independently of one another become strongly coupled. The study
               of these plasmas is important for our understanding of
               astrophysics, nuclear fusion and fundamental physics-however,
               the nonlinearities and strong couplings present in these extreme
               physical systems makes them very difficult to understand
               theoretically or to optimize experimentally. Here we argue that
               machine learning models and data-driven methods are in the
               process of reshaping our exploration of these extreme systems
               that have hitherto proved far too nonlinear for human
               researchers. From a fundamental perspective, our understanding
               can be improved by the way in which machine learning models can
               rapidly discover complex interactions in large datasets. From a
               practical point of view, the newest generation of extreme
               physics facilities can perform experiments multiple times a
               second (as opposed to approximately daily), thus moving away
               from human-based control towards automatic control based on
               real-time interpretation of diagnostic data and updates of the
               physics model. To make the most of these emerging opportunities,
               we suggest proposals for the community in terms of research
               design, training, best practice and support for synthetic
               diagnostics and data analysis.",

  abstract  = "Laser wakefield accelerators promise to revolutionize many areas
               of accelerator science. However, one of the greatest challenges
               to their widespread adoption is the difficulty in control and
               optimization of the accelerator outputs due to coupling between
               input parameters and the dynamic evolution of the accelerating
               structure. Here, we use machine learning techniques to automate
               a 100 MeV-scale accelerator, which optimized its outputs by
               simultaneously varying up to six parameters including the
               spectral and spatial phase of the laser and the plasma density
               and length. Most notably, the model built by the algorithm
               enabled optimization of the laser evolution that might otherwise
               have been missed in single-variable scans. Subtle tuning of the
               laser pulse shape caused an 80\% increase in electron beam
               charge, despite the pulse length changing by just 1\%.",

               plasmas has long required thorough, time-consuming analysis to
               extract meaningful source conditions. There are often
               confounding factors due to rapidly evolving states and finite
               spatial gradients (e.g., the existence of multi-temperature,
               multi-density, multi-ionization states, etc.) that make spectral
               measurements and analysis difficult. Here, we demonstrate how
               deep learning can be applied to enhance x-ray spectral data
               analysis in both speed and intricacy. Neural networks (NNs) are
               trained on ensemble atomic physics simulations so that they can
               subsequently construct a model capable of extracting plasma
               parameters directly from experimental spectra. Through deep
               learning, the models can extract temperature distributions as
               opposed to single or dual temperature/density fits from standard
               trial-and-error atomic modeling at a significantly reduced
               computational cost compared to traditional trial-and-error
               methods. These NNs are envisioned to be deployed with high
               repetition rate x-ray spectrometers in order to provide detailed
               real-time analysis of experimental spectra.",
