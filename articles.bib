  abstract  = "Laser wakefield accelerators promise to revolutionize many areas
               of accelerator science. However, one of the greatest challenges
               to their widespread adoption is the difficulty in control and
               optimization of the accelerator outputs due to coupling between
               input parameters and the dynamic evolution of the accelerating
               structure. Here, we use machine learning techniques to automate
               a 100 MeV-scale accelerator, which optimized its outputs by
               simultaneously varying up to six parameters including the
               spectral and spatial phase of the laser and the plasma density
               and length. Most notably, the model built by the algorithm
               enabled optimization of the laser evolution that might otherwise
               have been missed in single-variable scans. Subtle tuning of the
               laser pulse shape caused an 80\% increase in electron beam
               charge, despite the pulse length changing by just 1\%.",

  abstract  = "X-ray spectroscopic data from high-energy-density laser-produced
               plasmas has long required thorough, time-consuming analysis to
               extract meaningful source conditions. There are often
               confounding factors due to rapidly evolving states and finite
               spatial gradients (e.g., the existence of multi-temperature,
               multi-density, multi-ionization states, etc.) that make spectral
               measurements and analysis difficult. Here, we demonstrate how
               deep learning can be applied to enhance x-ray spectral data
               analysis in both speed and intricacy. Neural networks (NNs) are
               trained on ensemble atomic physics simulations so that they can
               subsequently construct a model capable of extracting plasma
               parameters directly from experimental spectra. Through deep
               learning, the models can extract temperature distributions as
               opposed to single or dual temperature/density fits from standard
               trial-and-error atomic modeling at a significantly reduced
               computational cost compared to traditional trial-and-error
               methods. These NNs are envisioned to be deployed with high
               repetition rate x-ray spectrometers in order to provide detailed
               real-time analysis of experimental spectra.",
