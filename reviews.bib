  abstract  = "Laser-plasma physics has developed rapidly over the past few
               decades as lasers have become both more powerful and more widely
               available. Early experimental and numerical research in this
               field was dominated by single-shot experiments with limited
               parameter exploration. However, recent technological
               improvements make it possible to gather data for hundreds or
               thousands of different settings in both experiments and
               simulations. This has sparked interest in using advanced
               techniques from mathematics, statistics and computer science to
               deal with, and benefit from, big data. At the same time,
               sophisticated modeling techniques also provide new ways for
               researchers to deal effectively with situation where still only
               sparse data are available. This paper aims to present an
               overview of relevant machine learning methods with focus on
               applicability to laser-plasma physics and its important
               sub-fields of laser-plasma acceleration and inertial confinement
               fusion.",

  abstract  = "Data science and technology offer transformative tools and
               methods to science. This review article highlights latest
               development and progress in the interdisciplinary field of
               data-driven plasma science (DDPS). A large amount of data and
               machine learning algorithms go hand in hand. Most plasma data,
               whether experimental, observational or computational, are
               generated or collected by machines today. It is now becoming
               impractical for humans to analyze all the data manually.
               Therefore, it is imperative to train machines to analyze and
               interpret (eventually) such data as intelligently as humans but
               far more efficiently in quantity. Despite the recent impressive
               progress in applications of data science to plasma science and
               technology, the emerging field of DDPS is still in its infancy.
               Fueled by some of the most challenging problems such as fusion
               energy, plasma processing of materials, and fundamental
               understanding of the universe through observable plasma
               phenomena, it is expected that DDPS continues to benefit
               significantly from the interdisciplinary marriage between plasma
               science and data science into the foreseeable future.",

  abstract  = "High-energy-density physics is the field of physics concerned
               with studying matter at extremely high temperatures and
               densities. Such conditions produce highly nonlinear plasmas, in
               which several phenomena that can normally be treated
               independently of one another become strongly coupled. The study
               of these plasmas is important for our understanding of
               astrophysics, nuclear fusion and fundamental physics-however,
               the nonlinearities and strong couplings present in these extreme
               physical systems makes them very difficult to understand
               theoretically or to optimize experimentally. Here we argue that
               machine learning models and data-driven methods are in the
               process of reshaping our exploration of these extreme systems
               that have hitherto proved far too nonlinear for human
               researchers. From a fundamental perspective, our understanding
               can be improved by the way in which machine learning models can
               rapidly discover complex interactions in large datasets. From a
               practical point of view, the newest generation of extreme
               physics facilities can perform experiments multiple times a
               second (as opposed to approximately daily), thus moving away
               from human-based control towards automatic control based on
               real-time interpretation of diagnostic data and updates of the
               physics model. To make the most of these emerging opportunities,
               we suggest proposals for the community in terms of research
               design, training, best practice and support for synthetic
               diagnostics and data analysis.",
