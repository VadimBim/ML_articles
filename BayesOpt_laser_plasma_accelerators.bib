               commonly explores the parameter space (plasma density, laser

               find an optimal configuration that, for example, minimizes the
               energy spread or emittance of the accelerated beam. However,
               laser-plasma acceleration is typically modeled with full
               particle-in-cell (PIC) codes, which can be computationally
               expensive. Various reduced models can approximate beam behavior
               at a much lower computational cost. Although such models do not
               capture the full physics, they could still suggest promising
               sets of parameters to be simulated with a full PIC code and
               thereby speed up the overall design optimization. In this work
               we automate such a workflow with a Bayesian multitask algorithm,

               from past simulation results from both full PIC codes and

  abstract  = "Bayesian optimization has proven to be an efficient method to
               optimize expensive-to-evaluate systems. However, depending on
               the cost of single observations, multi-dimensional optimizations
               of one or more objectives may still be prohibitively expensive.
               Multi-fidelity optimization remedies this issue by including
               multiple, cheaper information sources such as low-resolution
               approximations in numerical simulations. Acquisition functions
               for multi-fidelity optimization are typically based on
               exploration-heavy algorithms that are difficult to combine with
               optimization towards multiple objectives. Here we show that the
               expected hypervolume improvement policy can act in many
               situations as a suitable substitute. We incorporate the
               evaluation cost either via a two-step evaluation or within a
               single acquisition function with an additional fidelity-related
               objective. This permits simultaneous multi-objective and
               multi-fidelity optimization, which allows to accurately
               establish the Pareto set and front at fractional cost.
               Benchmarks show a cost reduction of an order of magnitude or
               more. Our method thus allows for Pareto optimization of
               extremely expansive black-box functions. The presented methods
               are simple and straightforward to implement in existing,
               optimized Bayesian optimization frameworks and can immediately
               be extended to batch optimization. The techniques can also be
               used to combine different continuous and/or discrete fidelity
               dimensions, which makes them particularly relevant for
               simulation problems in plasma physics, fluid dynamics and many
               other branches of scientific computing.",

  abstract  = "Beam parameter optimization in accelerators involves multiple,
               sometimes competing objectives. Condensing these individual
               objectives into a single figure of merit unavoidably results in
               a bias towards particular outcomes, in absence of prior
               knowledge often in a non-desired way. Finding an optimal
               objective definition then requires operators to iterate over
               many possible objective weights and definitions, a process that
               can take many times longer than the optimization itself. A more
               versatile approach is multi-objective optimization, which
               establishes the trade-off curve or Pareto front between
               objectives. Here we present the first results on multi-objective
               Bayesian optimization of a simulated laser-plasma accelerator.
               We find that multi-objective optimization reaches comparable
               performance to its single-objective counterparts while allowing
               for instant evaluation of entirely new objectives. This
               dramatically reduces the time required to find appropriate
               objective definitions for new problems. Additionally, our
               multi-objective, multi-fidelity method reduces the time required
               for an optimization run by an order of magnitude. It does so by
               dynamically choosing simulation resolution and box size,
               requiring fewer slow and expensive simulations as it learns
               about the Pareto-optimal solutions from fast low-resolution
               runs. The techniques demonstrated in this paper can easily be
               translated into many different computational and experimental
               use cases beyond accelerator optimization.",
